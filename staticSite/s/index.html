                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Inspiration strikes like a lightning (or a sneeze), catch it with <span>Annot.AI</span> and let it take care of tagging, categorizing, grouping your notes.</p>
                <p>You probably had to <em>tag</em> your notes in some app **cough**evernote**cough**. When you do so, it makes perfectly sense.
                <strong>But</strong>, a month later you struggle to find that special note and once you do you'll find yourself wondering <em>how the hell is this tag relevant?!</em></p>
                <p>With <span>Annot.AI</span> the app takes care of the boring stuff and leave you the fun.
                A logical and consistent approach to the content will make you be always on top of your own content.</p>
